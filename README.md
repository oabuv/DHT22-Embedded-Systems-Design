# DHT22_House temperature and humidity monitor
This project focuses on the DHT22 sensor and how to uztilize Modbus RTU frame to send and receive signals from and to master device.
In this project, the PCB module is designed and manufactured to plug in STM32L152RE to process the temperature and humidity data, then send the result to the
master device.
Wapice IoT-ticket is used to show the data sent to master device as a real-time graphs.
